          <!--
          <p>I am senior in Mira Costa High School.  I have an avid interest in the arts and media arts, and always makes an effort to learn a lot about different media arts and software tools.  My interests span 3D modeling, 2D graphic design, mobile apps
          UI design, and website design and development. </p> -->
          <p>
            I'm an artist and a high school senior student from the metropolitan city of Los Angeles. Ever since I picked up a crayon when I was young, I've never stopped drawing and creating. With my creative imagination, I am constantly exploring how to integrate art with technology, create performances and unique experiences across a variety of media and materials. My interests span virtual art, 2D graphic design, 3D modeling, mobile apps UI design, and dynamic website design and development. Whether I'm drawing a picture or designing interactive media, I'm driven by a passion for designing efficient, effortless, and empowering experiences.</p>
            <P>I'm excited to start my college career in the upcoming fall! Interactive Media Arts is my favorite potential major. When I was in middle school, I toured NYU and was really impressed to see a diverse and open-minded community NYU. I am excited by the IMA program as it combines a liberal arts core with technology, coding as well as creating physical and digital interactions. IMA professors are pioneers in their chosen fields so I look forward to learn and feel inspired by them. In particular, I'm interested in the diverse experiences of various teachers and staffs, such as some being game studios owners, curators of art exhibitions, and YouTubers with millions of subscribers. I would love the chance to study at NYU under the IMA major to pursue studies that align perfectly with my background and interests.</P>
