                   Life is like a kaleidoscope. It changes in color and shape. This piece is designed to serve as an artistic rendering of my identity. As an Asian American, finding ways to bring me closer to my community and expanding upon my roots is an essential part to my self development. I reflected on what has held a significant meaning to me during life. <br>
I used various colors and shapes to represent the rich experiences in my life. I embedded an image of LA (on the left) from an old magazine. I cut out irregular holes in a thicker piece of blue cardboard to symbolize my connected communities. I then glued a cardboard network to my chest, symbolizing how I put community first. The gemstones I glued down symbolize activities I have done with art and technology. It serves as a colorful reflection to my life experiences. I hope to show who I am to everyone who stumbles upon this piece.

                <p><b>Description</b>:<br>Life passes quickly. One day you are born, and in an instant you are quickly approaching the end of your life. Our memories are not always reliable as they fade over time, so I find it important to capture moments that help you remember and appreciate our lives. <br>
To convey this sentiment, I take moments from life and try to capture their essence on canvas. To emphasize the importance of life, I created flowing lines. These lines reveal the fleeting moments of life and how quickly they can go by if not paid attention to. The colors get darker as life goes on, but at the end of their life, the lighter purple color reveals that they are happier now that they lived their life fully. I created this piece to show the joy in life and to show people that they should pursue things they love while they are still young.

Even as I am getting older, I still feel young in spirit, revitalized by my passions and love for those close to me. In this piece, I want to depict just that; how everyone is beautiful and full of youth regardless of age or looks.<br>
                I glued down strips from old magazines to resemble aging, adding the frame by using colored hot glue. Using a thick sketchbook paper, I cut out flowers and painted over them using colors of undying orange and fading blue to represent beauty at different points in time. I added details of the flowers by using more hot glue and painting over it.<br>
                When I used a pencil to draw the woman's head and face, I left half of her hair white, to resemble the incoming elderly age. And I contrasted that with the youthful right side of her face to show the aging process.

                <p><b>Description</b>:<br>The Earth is full of numerous diseases. Cancer is the toughest disease on Earth. Currently, there is no cure for cancer yet, but there are plenty of individuals who want to help the fallen. Because of my leadership position in a volunteer community for cancer research and projects, I want to bring awareness to this situation and honor individuals by showing a snapshot of life. I also wanted to show my determination to fight against my Graves' disease.
                <br>
                I used a darker colored acrylic paint for the background to show the dangers of these diseases, but lighter colors for the hand to symbolize hope. Each floating organic and geometric shape counts as one of the diseases on Earth. Through this piece, I hope to express the idea that cancer won't be the end of anyone and that we should all remain hopeful.

In this piece, the shark and sea creatures are a metaphor for those types of thoughts, and the boat that dwells on those thoughts is rowing straight into danger.  <br> 
                I often ponder about my life choices so I decided to capture that essence of the thought in a painting. I mixed the colors with acrylic paint, drafted the shark and sea creatures, and painted until there was no white space left. Then I used a white gel pen to add the finishing touches of light against the shadows.<br>
                I tried to create a sense of depth to reflect the questions of uncertainty. I enlarged the shark to make it pop out by adding details and dimension. I displayed the hierarchy of the food chain to further emphasize the domination of the shark.

There is a blur of gray and blue everywhere which captures the essence of the mental drainage. The piece represents my mental state and feelings as I have experienced Graves' disease as a part of my life. <br>
                Before I started painting, I researched colors that symbolize sadness and how artists express emotions. I tried to show that even though the woman looks calm on the outside, on the inside she is harboring complicated feelings. Her emotions are stuck inside a tree above her head, always growing. I use strings of yarn and hot glue to reveal the knotty growth of the tree of emotions. I created the formation of the eye with a marker, to show the fragility of emotions. I hope to send comfort and a sense of belonging to individuals who are dealing with the same emotions.

                <p><b>Description</b>:<br>In the midst of summer heat, an ocean turtle swims by slowly in the air with a thriving forest on its back. Though old and weary of the heat, the turtle keeps on swimming. The turtle, a symbol of the desert cities, reveals the endless strength and the never ending growth of these cities. The turtle's resilience is what I admire the most, as I aspire to become as strong, physically and mentally.<br>
                I conceptualized the idea, drafted a design, and decided to use the medium of acrylic paint, as it is the longest-lasting painting material, to express the trait of resilience. I embroidered in the mushroom forest, painted in the background, and decided where the components would be by using embroidery string. I used acrylic paint to paint in the mushrooms and only knotted them in the middle. This painting allowed me to reflect upon how much the resilient community of the desert city of LA means to me.

                Using layers of oil pastel, I created a reflection on the water that symbolizes looking back at myself and who I was in the past. I blended the colors to tie multiple emotions to create a visual symphony. Although the piece is dark, the bright hues of the light reveal the darkness to fade away. The masts of the ship standing tall represent the inner strength I developed despite my turbulent emotions.

The drops reveal the flowing energy. Despite being a bowl of noodles, I wanted to use this dish to represent the intertwined nature of my cultural community. <br>
                Growing up in a tight knitted Chinese community, I tried to capture that essence into this painting. Chow Mein is a dense but flavorful Chinese food packed with nutrients and calories, just like how diverse and tight knitted my community is like.

                I was inspired by the way the fish was a symbol in both the cuisine and cultural norms of the Chinese. To emphasize their importance, I decided to make the fish as colorful as I could as well as placing the fish in the center of the painting. To highlight the fish, I painted a warm brown background and used turquoise to contrast with the gray color of the fish. I layered oil pastels on the paper until the shapes began to form, and thought carefully of the composition layout with the number of fish and dish layout.<br>
                Through this piece, I express that fish are not plain creatures, rather they have important meanings, both in my life and in my Chinese culture.

                On paper, I split the gigantic rocks into geometric shapes to emphasize color and shadows. I create the seasons of spring, as a time of growth, and winter, as a time of harshness, on the mountain by covering half of it with snow and the other half with green grass. The mist of the mountain shrouds some of the nearby mountains to emphasize its huge size. For this piece, I chose a limited color palette to reveal the beauty of the natural colors on mountains. <br>
                Mountains are beautiful, strong and protective, something I find solace in and in turn, something I strive to be.

                My process includes painting with acrylic paint and creating different colors to make the woman's future a brighter place where she can comfortably navigate. What she has experienced dots her world with color, and the bubbles of her hometown support her as she floats toward the future. I created the bubbles by painting circles with a blue color to symbolize the ocean and the woman's hometown. By using the end of a paintbrush, I splatter paint onto the canvas, to reveal the individuals I have met in my life and the experiences that color my world. <br>
                Throughout this piece, I hope to create a sense in individuals that they should be confident about the future.

                I painted South Africa's Cape Malay Curry Chicken dish in the form of South Africa's national flower. The flower just not only represents the dish but also represents the country as a whole. The green colors represent the beauty and nature of the country, and the rice symbolizes the population that makes up South Africa's vibrant and colorful region. <br>

Sometimes I like to place objects such as the M&Ms and the bird where they don't belong to make them stand out, and to juxtapose the man-made with nature. <br>
                I splotch the paper with color to create a sense of timelessness. I keenly observe and pay close attention to detail. I perform my craft with love for every object and treat every crack in the wall or crinkle in the fabric or material as an individual. This challenged me to think artistically and critically about the layout, light, and shade. I use pencils, colored pencils, and markers to explore a new depth of value and expression. <br>
                Through this sketch, I hope to reveal that simple objects such as a vase and the interior of the room are important landmarks in life.
